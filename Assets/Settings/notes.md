- fix: railgun projectile layer masks
- todo: weapon next should take into account if it has ammo or not! this is important
- ??: player skill manager?

- [] audio manager
- [] add map

---

- [] cinemachine confiner
- [] accuracy system. weapon needs to pass player and it requires if it is hit or not.
  push to an array and if its not hit 0, then calculate accuracy from total shots?

- if an enemy is killed with chainsaw do not spawn death vfx


### NOTES

Quad should be spawned in game manager after 30s or so.
